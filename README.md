block design:

2 x sequence/sequence-1.psyexp (each block ~6 min)
2 x sequence/sequence-2.psyexp (each block ~6 min)
1 x sequence-lexical_decision/sequence-1_LD.psyexp (each block ~2 min)
1 x sequence-lexical_decision/sequence-2_LD.psyexp (each block ~2 min)

there are specific running instructions in the sequence folder and in the sequence-lexical_decision folder.
